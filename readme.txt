= How to add NPR currency in WooCommerce site? =
WooCommerce does not have NPR by default. You can use following code and paste it in `functions.php` of your theme to add NPR currency.
`
function prefix_add_my_currency( $currencies ) {
     $currencies['NPR'] = __( 'Nepali rupee', 'woocommerce' );
     return $currencies;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_currencies', 'prefix_add_my_currency' );


function prefix_add_my_currency_symbol( $currency_symbol, $currency ) {
     switch( $currency ) {
          case 'NPR': $currency_symbol = 'NRs'; break;
     }
     return $currency_symbol;
}
add_filter('woocommerce_currency_symbol', 'prefix_add_my_currency_symbol', 10, 2);
